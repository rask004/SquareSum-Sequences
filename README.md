# SquareSum-Sequences
single webpage project showcasing a D3 graph study of the "square-sum sequences" maths problem. Intended for Students curious about D3 and coding.

# Technology
Vanilla Webpage (Plain HTML, CSS, JS) with an offline copy of the D3 JS.

# Visualisation
The user can choose a range of numbers, always beginning with 1, up to a selected number.

Then the Graph updates to show the sequence of numbers, horizontally, with curved lines connecting any two numbers that sum to a perfect square.

The Graph periodically rearranges curved lines for easier visualisation.

Due to view port restrictions, the Graph can become crowded for sequences up to 64 or greater.

# Students
This demonstrates:

- How HTML, CSS and JS files interact.
- How to import code from one JS script into another, and how to declare these scripts for the import(s) to work.
- How to use JS code to draw SVG (Scaled Vector Graphics) to create images dynamically.
- How to use the D3 JS library to draw a visualisation.
